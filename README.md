=============

1. CSO Realtime data viewer - take csv data from ftp site and join together location data csv in python. Use python to create geojson format that you can push into GitHub to display in their map. you then take that map and embed in the website or use geojson data to use it in Leaflet or BootLeaf(bootstrap-leaflet example) to share the map.

2. Offline - WTD facility Viewer: Able to view and access WTD data using locally stored data using local browser to view. Create off-line WTD facility viewer map: This will use TileMill to generate using OSM data and KC sewer data to generate MbTiles by stylize using TileMill. Use Dane's porable-node-app (tilestream) to server leaflet web viewer with locally stored data.
